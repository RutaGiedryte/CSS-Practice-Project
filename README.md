# CSS-Practice-Project
A small page built following a course "CSS Essential Training" from LinkedIn Learning

I followed the course as a part of LinkedIn Learning "Become a Front-End Web Developer" learning path. The design of my page is a spin-off of the one created by the instructor Christina Truong. All of the information on the page is entirely fictional.
